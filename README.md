# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello earthlings,

Jurek here, I don't know what I'm doing, which is precisely why I am trying to learn how to code and learn what this Github is. I have no idea what Git or Github is. I know you can share and collaborate on projects here, but whatever.

I like burritos, hate driving and want to live in New York, and I like to play Solitaire at the gym.
